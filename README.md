# 2048 Game

This project is a JavaScript implementation of the popular 2048 game. Players combine numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid to reach the tile with the value 2048. The project is built with a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript structure, making use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## Demo

Play the live version of the 2048 game [here](https://ekateriina7.github.io/js-game-2048/).

## Features

- **Move tiles in 4 directions**: Move tiles left, right, up, and down to combine them.
- **Game status tracking**: Tracks the game state (`idle`, `playing`, `win`, or `lose`).
- **Score system**: Score updates dynamically as tiles combine.
- **Random tile generation**: New tiles appear on the board after each move.
- **Game win and lose detection**: Detects when the player wins (reaches 2048) or loses (no valid moves).
